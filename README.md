Human Age, Gender and Ethnicity Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract
One of the key components in identifying a person is their face. Science is still conducting research to classify organisms based on the many characteristics of the human body and face. Human faces are primarily categorised according to the age, gender, ethnicity, and expression of the individual. These classifications can be utilised successfully in a variety of contexts, such as business and government. It is frequently used to give kids access to age-appropriate content. In this study, the best machine learning model was chosen after comparing multiple models to improve age, gender, and ethnicity prediction. Therefore, face recognition and other tasks requiring a variety of skills have significantly improved. As hyperparameters are crucial for determining the best deep learning or machine learning model, the goal is to select the best model by incorporating hyperparameter optimization and using them for precise real-time prediction.

1.	Introduction
When communicating amongst people, human faces convey a lot of nonverbal information. The faces of individuals can reveal a variety of characteristics, including age, gender, expression, and ethnicity. Both human-to-human and human-computer interactions can benefit from these qualities. The facial characteristics are often assessed separately and independently from one another given a face image. (Guodong and Wvu) . 
	Three processes make up the overall flow of face recognition: capturing face photos using a camera with visible or near-infrared illumination, extracting features from face images, and determining how similar the features are to one another. The benefit of face recognition is that it has a simpler image acquisition process than other biometric recognition technologies like iris and fingerprint recognition because it doesn't need specialised equipment to take pictures of people's faces. Face recognition has the drawback of having low recognition accuracy because face images are drastically altered by changes in head posture, expression, ageing, etc. (Ito et al., Nov 2018) . Machine learning methodologies are utilized for classification tasks to good effect. Four major approaches for machine learning algorithms — K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Convolutional Neural Nertwork (CNN), Naive Bayes, and Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN)—are primarily used among them. Age, gender, and ethnicity can all be predicted using one of these four methods. Frequently, grid searches or manual methods of hyperparameter tuning are used. 
	Recent studies have revealed that automatic optimization strategies can speed up this optimization process and identify hyperparameter settings that produce superior models. (Wistuba, Schilling and Schmidt-Thieme, Oct 2015)   According to this study, a more precise prediction model can be produced by combining a powerful machine learning algorithm with hyperparameter optimization. Our goal is to create a system that can accurately anticipate a person's age, gender, and ethnicity without jeopardising his or her security or evading any other security measures. Such effective techniques are beneficial in many ways when carrying out various tasks. Building a model that can properly estimate age, gender, and ethnicity is our key objective. It also seeks to be used to age-specific content access restrictions, where the system might determine a person's age, gender, and race and decide whether to allow or deny access depending on those characteristics. (Ito et al., Nov 2018)

3.	Literature Review

The literature review on age, gender, and ethnicity identification using various methods and algorithms is described in this part. Ultimately, the classification of age, gender and ethnicity originates from the advanced technology of the process of face detection. A face detection and recognition programme are a piece of software that helps identify people in videos or photos by looking at their faces. The older research on face detection may be found in technical journals, at least for psychoanalytic theory in the 1950s and 1960s. Experiments on Darwin's instincts for facial expression are some of the earliest discoveries. Facial recognition is rapid and accurate with Intel's OpenCV open-source software platform.
Human face pictures reveal a variety of information, including nationality, age, and gender. By automatically detecting faces, recognising gestures and faces, and determining age, gender, and ethnicity, computer vision and pattern recognition in the field of computer vision provide an ideal role in humans. So, it is important to make sure users and consumers are aware if an application incorporates facial recognition technologies. By doing this, you can help others learn about these technologies. It also gives folks who come to or utilise your facilities or technology the option to determine if they want to keep doing so. 
2.1.	Face Detection
(Khan et al., Oct 2019a)  describes Popular biometrics research topics include face detection and image or video recognition. A fascinating field and a quickly escalating problem exist in real-time face recognition. Programming is simple to use due to Intel's open-source Computer-View library. This offers sophisticated features including several ready-to-use artificial intelligence approaches, including image retrieval, facial tracking, image recognition, and others (AI). It is a model of learning that utilizes computers that builds a cascade function out of numerous both positive and negative expressions. This is then utilised to find items. computing "features" recognised by the hair cascades by "integral image" techniques.
 (Abirami, Subashini and Mahavaishnavi, 2020) proposed the video from the camera may be captured and transformed to picture frames using OpenCV's incredibly straightforward user interface. It used to be common practise to use the pre-trained haar cascade model for face identification, but currently researchers are turning to OpenCV and a deep neural face image detection method based that has been taught model for faster and additional accurate face image detection. In general, Haar cascade Classifier and LBP Cascade Classifier are the two main methods used by OpenCV to locate faces. The Haar classifier is utilised in this study since it is slower than LBP but more accurate.
2.2.	Feature Extraction
(Opencv et al., 2021a)  described that There are three fundamental processes in face recognition: face detection, face recognition, and face extraction. In order to locate the face, any system must first capture the image and thereafter manage and record the crucial elements. It maintains records of several features, including skin tone and colour, for the purpose of identifying the taken image. Regions of the face, differences in the anatomy of the face, and formatted and styled face cuts and angles can all be considered facial characteristics. Grabbers of camera characteristics are also used in face extraction. The different areas of the image that are extremely black or extremely brilliant are removed from the image at this stage. Examples of these are the region surrounding the eyes, the region around the nose, or the region below the lips. The most pertinent region that is covered by skin is obtained by removing these areas, and accurate detection is then possible. 
(Srinivas et al., May 2017)  is explained Each of the sub-networks learns features individually, then they are combined and delivered to a layer that is fully connected utilises the cost function as the square difference and may be considered to be a linear regressor. The sub-networks are made up of a locally connected layer, a max-pooling layer, and a convolutional layer. Additionally, that use a unique function lost for determining ethnicity, gender, and age to train the network to learn while performing several tasks. They test the effectiveness of the suggested method using the MORPH 2 dataset, showing a decreased age estimation error rate compared to employing biologically inspired characteristics. 
2.3.	Classification
 (Mahapatra et al., 2021) presented a comprehensive study on several methods and settings for estimating age and gender. The study's framework specifically is a recently discovered common framework: People's facial features may nearly instantly reveal a person's gender to humans. Although automating the same task is challenging, incredible progress has been achieved in automatically predicting facial photos over the previous ten years. The project recognises or determines the gender based on the provided facial photos. The initiative was motivated by robbery, fraud, child molestation, lack of security, and criminal identification. 
 (Levi and Hassncer, Jun 2015a) provide an innovative method for employing a CNN to classify gender in real-time in this research. These are the primary takeaways from this study. For real-time face-based gender classification, a 4-layer CNN is first proposed. Comparing the network architecture to previous approaches, we find that it has a lower design complexity because there are fewer layers, neurons, trainable parameters, and connections.  (LIEW et al., 2016)  In this study, a gap between automatic facial recognition and gender and age estimate methods is attempted to be filled. To achieve this, we follow the excellent example offered by existing technology for facial recognition. Techniques that have been released recently show that CNN can also be utilised to significantly improve facial recognition systems. 
 (Taunk et al., May 2019a)  provides various categorization criteria are applied to determine the categorization to which the unlabelled data belongs. KNN is most frequently used as a classifier. It is used to classify data in a specific area based on local or adjacent training samples. This method is used because of its quick analysis and simplicity. It uses the Euclidean distance to locate its nearest neighbours when working with continuous data. The classification for a new sample is selected by the majority of the neighbouring data, and the K nearest neighbours are calculated. Although this classifier is simple, the value of "K" is essential for locating the unlabelled data.
 (Phuiig et al.) proposes a Bayesian classifier is used to first find skin patches in the colour input image. Eye areas are distinguished by their colour characteristic within each skin region. Two face candidates are created for each detected eye pair using a geometric face model that specifies the face region border in terms of the locations of the two eyes. A number of heuristics about the face were preliminary verified against all face candidates. The remaining candidates are turned so that their eyes are horizontal, and they are standing straight. For the classification of faces from nonfaces, a single naive Bayes classifier may be used. However, we believe that using an ensemble of numerous classifiers that also are derived from various feature extraction techniques will improve classification. As a result, we test this theory by evaluating the effectiveness of a grouping of four distinct classifiers.
 (Girshick, Dec 2015) Explained an input image and several regions of concern (RoIs) are fed into a fully convolutional network. Before mapping each RoI to a feature vector, completely connected layers pool each RoI into a corrected feature map (FCs). The 2 output arrays of the network for each RoI are the per-class bounding-box regress offsets and softmax probabilities. From start to finish, the architecture is trained using a multi-task loss. The h w RoI window is subdivided into a H w matrix of sub-windows that really are roughly h/H w/W in size to enhance the pooling of the data in each sub-window into to the accompanying output grid cell.

2.4.	Hyperparameter Optimization
 (Dong et al., 2021) Investigate the most effective and dynamic selection of hyperparameters for visual object tracking, abbreviated tracking throughout the remainder of the work. The hyperparameter optimization algorithms, while efficient for some applications, have issues when used for tracking for a variety of reasons, including their extreme computing weight and the lack of dataset of training for a general fix. For instance, a modern tracker spends a lot of time random grid cv searching 200 times over a validating dataset of 120 films to modify five hyperparameters. Additionally, because tracking can encounter a variety of difficulties that are impractical to address in just 129 sequences, the updated hyperparameters might not be appropriate for all inputs.
 (Kim and Cho, Jun 2019) proposes a methodology for simultaneously locating the activation function and optimization technique in deep learning by focusing on the relationship between forward and backward processes. Given that the deep learning model's search space is relatively broad, the model is searched using genetic programming to locate the ideal point inside the space.  (Shawki et al., Dec 04, 2021) Explained about the standard method for fine-tuning hyperparameters entails manual search, where tests are carried out by a specialist using prior knowledge, experience, and, of course, trial and error. Since this method necessitates a thorough comprehension of the algorithms, it is frequently time-consuming, laborious, and computationally expensive. To discover the best answer, automated search methods are used in the current research field of auto tuning. The approaches for automating the optimization process include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Gradient-based Optimization.
A generic pipeline for producing the best vector representations of topographical data features is presented in  (Motta et al., Dec 2019a) . Machine learning techniques can then use these vector representations. Each configuration point in this pipeline's complex configuration space defines how features are created and how guesses are learned using those features. This pipeline can be compared to a pricey black-box function. We suggest that while picking learning model parameters, topological vectorization hyperparameters be chosen with the use of cutting-edge Bayesian optimization techniques. With the help of two challenging biological learning problems, we show the value and efficiency of this pipeline and highlight the complex relationships between topological feature creation and learning system hyperparameters.
 (Liu, Wu and Chen, Dec 2020) described the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms depends heavily on hyperparameter optimization (HPO). The computing cost of algorithm assessment is quite high when the method is sophisticated or the datasets is vast, which is a significant barrier for HPO. In this study, we provide an effective hyperparameter tuning technique based on reinforcement learning. A RL agent successively chooses hyperparameters, drastically condensing the search space. The agent is updated using the k-fold cross-validation outcome as a reward signal. We use a prediction model to assess an algorithm using the chosen hyperparameters to hasten the agent's training process.
2.5.	Age, Gender, and Ethnicity
 (Hiremath, Patil and Patil, Dec 03, 2021) Proposed that the inevitable stochastic process of ageing affects both people and other living things, and it plays a significant role in face appearance. Human ageing is influenced by both factors, such as variations in softer and bonier facial shapes. The appearance of the face varies greatly depending on age. At various ages, a face takes on a varied appearance. As a result, a technique for determining age and gender from facial features must be developed. Gender identification based on facial traits is widely used in human-computer intercommunication. Additionally, it has many fascinating uses, ranging from online picture searches to automatically determining gender. Researchers have identified gender using a variety of techniques, including 3D facial data, speech, and face picture. Age and gender classification problems still have many unresolved challenges. Despite the advances in vision - based sectors, which continue to produce trying to cut techniques that advance the state-of-the-art, the demands of industry and actual implementation for gender and age estimations on realistic, actual models are still being satisfied.
 (Masood et al., 2018)  Face analysis has been one of the most thoroughly studied study areas in the domains of feature detection and computer vision during the past few decades, as described. Although a person's face can reveal a range of demographic details, including gender, age, and ethnicity, ethnicity nevertheless stands out as a constant and essential characteristic that can't be easily concealed, even in disguise, like age and gender. As a result, classifying people according to age and gender could not only make the task more complex, but would also produce inaccurate results. Because of this, identifying people by their ethnicity is an important feature that can be used in different systems for video surveillance at security checks.
 (Shanthi et al., Jan 20, 2022) Explained age and gender, two important facemask characteristics, are fundamental components of social communication, so estimating them from just one picture is a critical access control, human-computer interface, legal usage, product marketing, and visual examination are only a few examples of tasks in intelligent applications. It is possible to make assumptions about the user's gender and age and utilise this data to create customised products and explanations for each user. By targeting the target audience according to gender and age, it processes a crucial function in marketing for the marketer. 
2.6.	Applications and Ethics
(Shanthi et al., Jan 20, 2022) Described age recognition is important in probe by the police and intelligence gathering since it aids in identifying the real criminals and thieves based on his age. They might receive a selected outcome that excludes anyone who has engaged in illegal or other behaviour. The real age and anticipated age would've been roughly the similar if someone gave a skewed assessment of their age after learning the results of an age identification programme. This dependability creates a trustworthiness for numerous other beneficial daily activities. 
Human face pictures reveal a variety of information, including nationality, age, and gender. By automatically detecting faces, recognising gestures and faces, and determining age, gender, and ethnicity, pattern classification and computer vision in the field of machine vision provide an optimum human function. So, it is important to make sure users and consumers are aware if an application incorporates facial recognition technologies. By doing this, you can help others learn about these technologies. It also gives folks who come to or utilise your facilities or technology the option to determine if they want to keep doing so. Technology that recognises or analyses faces points out that it has many applications, identifying missing children, monitoring criminals, making it simpler to use phones and automated teller machines, and assisting robots to communicate with individuals by identifying their personalities and feelings, and in some medical studies, remotely diagnosing or tracking willing participants. However, people should endeavour to prevent the use of technology that may remotely identify or categorise them without their knowledge because it is inherently risky.
3.	Human Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Prediction
3.1.	Problem Analysis
The human face can contain information about a person's identity, emotional expression, gender, age, ethnicity, and other personal characteristics. The face's look is significantly impacted by getting older. This is crucial for interpersonal nonverbal communication. Age and gender are two fundamental facial characteristics that are vital to social interactions. Identifying age and sexual orientation from a single face image is consequently a crucial task in machine learning applications including access control, human-computer interaction, police departments, product marketing, and visual surveillance. Because it is a component of social identity and reflects a person's identity, values, and emotions, ethnic identity is also significant. Automatic classification of age, gender, and ethnicity has developed to the point where it is required for long-term use, primarily because old age is linked to online media and social media platforms. However, compared to the enormous performance gains recently shown for the related job of facial recognition, the effectiveness of current solutions based on real-time photos is insufficient.
Here going to find the solutions for the below key objectives
•	To develop a python module to predict Age, Gender and Ethnicity using highly accurate machine learning model
•	To find the best machine learning algorithm for prediction from different Machine learning Algorithms such as KNN, Naive Bayes, CNN and RCNN.
•	To find the best parameter values for each Machine Learning Algorithms and use it for prediction
•	To detect the face from own camera and predict the age, gender, and ethnicity of that face.  
Hyperparameter optimization techniques have been used in many machine learning algorithms to make more accurate predictions, so it is possible to find the best algorithm and their parameter values in the prediction of age, gender, and ethnicity even though many machine learning algorithms have been tried and failed to find age, gender, and ethnicity on numerous occasions.
3.2.	Solution Design
In unrestricted real-life circumstances, such those at train stations, banking, bus stations, and airports, the classification of gender, age, and ethnicity can forecast gender, age, and ethnicity. In human-computer interaction, gender may often be determined based on features of the face. Furthermore, it can be used for a variety of exciting things, including gender auto-detection and internet image searches. Using a range of methods, including facial photos, voice, and 3D face data, researchers have been able to determine a person's gender. As technology advances, it becomes more useful for business and actual solutions to guess age, ethnicity, and gender.
The main goal of the entire project is to develop a Python module to forecasting Gender, Ethnicity, and Age using a highly accurate machine learning model, find the best machine learning algorithm from a variety of algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes, CNN, and RCNN, and use it for prediction. Another goal is to detect faces from one's own camera and predict the age, gender, and ethnicity of those faces. In order to satisfy all of these needs, a suitable structure was designed.
